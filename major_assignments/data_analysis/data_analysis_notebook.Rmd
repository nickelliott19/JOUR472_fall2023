md_payments <- read_csv("/Users/nicholaselliott19/Desktop/UMD/Courses/JOUR472/JOUR472_fall2023/major_assignments/data_analysis/State_of_Maryland_Payments_Data__FY2008_to_FY2024.csv")|> clean_names()
# There are 430,584 rows and 8 columns.
# It could be difficult to define what an "industry" would be and narrowing down the differences like mental health vs. medical health.
# We have to be able to define the category and what it could help us define.

### Questions 1: How does the distribution of spending change from year to year?
# Grouping the md_payments by fiscal year to show payment totals for each year
options(scipen = 999)
md_payments_fiscal_year <- md_payments |>
  group_by(fiscal_year)|>
  summarize(amount=sum(amount))|>
  arrange(desc(total))|>
  # Removed 2023 because it has repeated values that inflate it's number
  filter(fiscal_year != "2023")|>
  # Removed 2024 because the year is not over yet thus spending is not comparable
  filter(fiscal_year != "2024")



md_payments_fiscal_year|>
ggplot() +
geom_line(aes(x=fiscal_year, y=amount)) +
    coord_flip()+
  labs(
    title = "Maryland State Payments By Fiscal Year ",
    y = "Total Amount",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    caption = "Source: Maryland State Payments Data"
  )
```
```{r}
### Question 2: What counties or zip codes receive the most money?
#Getting acs data on ZCTA
# This is zcta data to show how much money is going to each zcta so we can see where money is most allocated
md_zip_population <- get_acs(geography = "zcta",
              variables = c(population = "B01001_001"),
              year = 2019,
              state = "MD")
```

```{r}
# Filtering md_payments to match the ZCTA data
md_payments_2019 <- md_payments |>
  filter(fiscal_year=="2019")|>
  group_by(vendor_zip)|>
  summarize(amount=sum(amount))|>
  arrange(desc(amount))
```

```{r}
# Joining the md_payments with ZCTA data
md_payments_2019 <- md_payments_2019 |>
  inner_join(md_zip_population, by=c('vendor_zip'='GEOID'))
```

```{r}
# Calculating rate to see money spend in relation to population of a given zip code
md_payments_2019 <- md_payments_2019 |>
  mutate(rate = estimate/amount*100)
```

```{r}
# Filtering just for the zip code with the most money given and we can see Baltimore County Public Schools as getting the most money
md_payments |>
  filter(vendor_zip == 21202) |>
  arrange(desc(amount))
```

```{r}
### Questions 3:  Which industries spent the most money?

# Payments by industry

#Health
industry_data_health <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HEALTH")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_health = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HEALTH")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Education
industry_data_education <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "EDUCATION") | str_detect(agency_name, "SCHOOL")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_education = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "EDUCATION") | str_detect(agency_name, "SCHOOL")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Housing
industry_data_housing <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HOUSING")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_housing = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HOUSING")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Crime
industry_data_crime <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "POLICE") | str_detect(agency_name, "CRIME") | str_detect(agency_name, "SAFETY")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_crime = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "POLICE") | str_detect(agency_name, "CRIME") | str_detect(agency_name, "SAFETY")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Labor
industry_data_labor <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "LABOR")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_labor = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "LABOR")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Environment
industry_data_environment <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "ENVIRONMENT") | str_detect(agency_name, "AGRICULTURE")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_environment = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "ENVIRONMENT") | str_detect(agency_name, "AGRICULTURE")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Commerce
industry_data_commerce <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "COMMERCE") | str_detect(agency_name, "COMPTROLLER")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_commerce = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "COMMERCE") | str_detect(agency_name, "COMPTROLLER")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#Transportation
industry_data_transportation <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HIGH") | str_detect(agency_name, "TRANS") | str_detect(agency_name, "MDOT")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_transportation = sum(amount))

md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "HIGH") | str_detect(agency_name, "TRANS") | str_detect(agency_name, "MDOT")) |>
  count(agency_name)

#combine them all
all_industry_data <- industry_data_commerce |>
    inner_join(industry_data_crime, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_education, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_environment, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_health, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_housing, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_labor, by = 'fiscal_year') |>
    inner_join(industry_data_transportation, by = 'fiscal_year')
```
```{r}
### Question 4: Where are lower payments going compared to higher ones?

# Filtering low payments by the amount being under $100
md_payments_low <- md_payments |>
  filter(amount < 100) |>
  rename(amount_low = amount)

# Just showing the 4 columns to see who gets a lot of low payments, which is the Maryland State Department of Education
md_payments_low |>
  group_by(agency_name) |>
  summarise(vendor_name, amount_low, count=n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))

# Filtering high payments by the amount being above $1 million
md_payments_high <- md_payments |>
  filter(amount > 1000000) |>
  rename(amount_high = amount)

# Just showing the 4 columns to see who gets a lot of high payments, which is The Maryland Department of Health 
md_payments_high |> 
  group_by(agency_name) |>
  summarise(vendor_name, amount_high, count=n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```
```{r}
### Question 5: What types of payments are going to education? Are there differences in which systems receive more/less money

# We used the data from the previous questions about industry to then look closer at the education sector

# This is the previous data
industry_data_education <- md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "EDUCATION") | str_detect(agency_name, "SCHOOL")) |>
  group_by(fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(total_education = sum(amount))

# This shows how many times a vendor comes up in the data but not entirely showing if they got the most money
md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "EDUCATION") | str_detect(agency_name, "SCHOOL")) |>
  count(agency_name)

# This just arranges by amount so you can see which vendor got the most money, in this case, Mount Rainier Police Department
md_payments |>
  filter(str_detect(agency_name, "EDUCATION") | str_detect(agency_name, "SCHOOL")) |>
  arrange(desc(amount))
```
